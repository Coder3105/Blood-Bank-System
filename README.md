# Blood Bank Management System

A web-based Blood Bank Management System designed to streamline the process of blood donation and blood request management. This system allows **users**, **admin**, and **hospitals** to interact with the system in different ways. The project uses **React.js** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, **MongoDB** as the database, and **Material-UI** for styling the components.
